    Land
    
        This type of good is not divisible and is measured in m^2. If a family member already has land,
        
        and receives some, the size of the lands are added together and it is considered to be the same
        
        good. Each m^2 is worth €300
    
    Money

Heritage distribution

Upon the death of a family member, their property is shared as follows:

● Their money is split in equal parts between the descendants. They, in turn, give 50% to

their descendants, and so on. As Euros cannot be shared, in the case of rounding, the

older descendants get the larger share.

Example: member A has 3 children (B,C,D) and receives 100000€ when one of his

parent dies. He keeps 50000€. B, C, and D receive 16667€, 16667€, 16666€

respectively. If one of these children (B,C,D) has children as well, then they must give

away 50% to their children.

● The land is always given to the oldest child. If there are two children of the same age,

the one with their name first in alphabetic order receives it.

● Estates are given one by one, starting with the oldest child. If there are more estates

than children, then allocation starts again with the oldest child.

● If the deceased had no children, then the inheritance is not calculated.

● Only the money is shared pyramidally passing on to descendants, the rest of the goods

are inherited directly by the immediate children.
